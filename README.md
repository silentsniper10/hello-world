# Project definition
My web application social network will be a platform where people are able to sell or buy new or used items to other people but more specifically tools for a lawn, backyard or hardwware specfici stuff. The homepage is where the user should be able to browse through a few items that will show basic detial like the item, location of the person, name. Some of these items include things like electrical drills, lawnmowers, hedgetrimmers, and the price of the item  should also be clearly listed where the user is able to see  There will also be a button on that item that says something like read more, where when the user presses on it will bring them to another page and show the user more specific details about the item. And on that page you can press a button that leads you to the checkout where the user can purchase the items.
